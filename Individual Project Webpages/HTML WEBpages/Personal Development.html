	<center><h1> My Three (3) major Strengths</center></h1>
	<center><p><h2>I believe that life is a learning experience and being able to recognize my own strength, can help me become a better individual in anything I choose to do.
	One of my strength is, my top-notch communication skills. I was complimented by a friend back when I was in high school that I had that strength. It was on a particular day in high school, I helped one of my close friend get through a rough patch that she was experincing with her mother. We spoke every break that we would get after classes just to 
	comfort and assure her that things will always be better. </center></p></h2>
	<br/><br/>
	<center><p><h2> Another strength is, Mediation. I find that to be a powerful tool that I use because it has helped me quiet negtaive thoughts, negative doubts
	to improve my self-esteem. It has helped me cultivate self-confidence, integrity, authenticity and acceptance. My strengths may not be your atypical strengths that persons
describe about their self furing an interview or a one on one conversation. My stregths has to do with more than just traits and characteristics.<center><p></h2>
<br/><br/>
<center><p><h2> Lastly, I am a observant detailed-oriented person which I beleive is one of my strengths. I tend to notice problems before they become a problem, notice mistakes that may or not be serious and can read people pretty well. When I mean by being detailed oriented is, I'm likely to be more interested in the smaller system that makes up a car.
Nevertheless, all of classified my 3 major strengths has help me become the person I am today. They have helped me change for the better, grow and evolve. I still belive I have  alot of learning to do, alot of phasesto get through, obstatcles to overcome and rivers to cross, but with the help of my inner stregths I believe I can get through it all.</center></p></h2>
